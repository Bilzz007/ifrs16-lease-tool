International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (IFRS 16) is set out in paragraphs
1–106 and Appendices A–D. All the paragraphs have equal authority. Paragraphs
in bold type state the main principles. Terms defined in Appendix A are in italics the
first time that they appear in the Standard. Definitions of other terms are given in the
Glossary for International Financial Reporting Standards. The Standard should be read
in the context of its objective and the Basis for Conclusions, the Preface to IFRS
Standards and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. IAS 8 Accounting Policies,
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors provides a basis for selecting and applying
accounting policies in the absence of explicit guidance.

International Financial Reporting Standard 16
Leases
Objective
This Standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of leases. The objective is to ensure that lessees
and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully
represents those transactions. This information gives a basis for users of
financial statements to assess the effect that leases have on the financial
position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity.
An entity shall consider the terms and conditions of contracts and all relevant
facts and circumstances when applying this Standard. An entity shall apply
this Standard consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in
similar circumstances.
Scope
An entity shall apply this Standard to all leases, including leases of right-of-use
assets in a sublease, except for:
(a)
leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-
regenerative resources;
(b)
leases of biological assets within the scope of IAS 41 Agriculture held by
a lessee;
(c)
service concession arrangements within the scope of IFRIC 12 Service
Concession Arrangements;
(d)
licences of intellectual property granted by a lessor within the scope of
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; and
(e)
rights held by a lessee under licensing agreements within the scope of
IAS 38 Intangible Assets for such items as motion picture films, video
recordings, plays, manuscripts, patents and copyrights.
A lessee may, but is not required to, apply this Standard to leases of intangible
assets other than those described in paragraph 3(e).
Recognition exemptions (paragraphs B3–B8)
A lessee may elect not to apply the requirements in paragraphs 22–49 to:
(a)
short-term leases; and
(b)
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (as described in
paragraphs B3–B8)."

IFRS 16

© IFRS Foundation
If a lessee elects not to apply the requirements in paragraphs 22–49 to either
short-term leases or leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the
lessee shall recognise the lease payments associated with those leases as an
expense on either a straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic
basis. The lessee shall apply another systematic basis if that basis is more
representative of the pattern of the lessee’s benefit.
If a lessee accounts for short-term leases applying paragraph 6, the lessee shall
consider the lease to be a new lease for the purposes of this Standard if:
(a)
there is a lease modification; or
(b)
there is any change in the lease term (for example, the lessee exercises
an option not previously included in its determination of the lease
term).
The election for short-term leases shall be made by class of underlying asset to
which the right of use relates. A class of underlying asset is a grouping of
underlying assets of a similar nature and use in an entity’s operations. The
election for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value can be made
on a lease-by-lease basis.
Identifying a lease (paragraphs B9–B33)
At inception of a contract, an entity shall assess whether the contract is, or
contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration. Paragraphs B9–B31 set out guidance on the
assessment of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.
A period of time may be described in terms of the amount of use of an
identified asset (for example, the number of production units that an item of
equipment will be used to produce).
An entity shall reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease only if the
terms and conditions of the contract are changed.
Separating components of a contract
For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, an entity shall account for each
lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease
components of the contract, unless the entity applies the practical expedient
in paragraph 15. Paragraphs B32–B33 set out guidance on separating
components of a contract.
Lessee
For a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional
lease or non-lease components, a lessee shall allocate the consideration in the
contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price
of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease
components."

IFRS 16

A823
The relative stand-alone price of lease and non-lease components shall be
determined on the basis of the price the lessor, or a similar supplier, would
charge an entity for that component, or a similar component, separately. If an
observable stand-alone price is not readily available, the lessee shall estimate
the stand-alone price, maximising the use of observable information.
As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to
separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account
for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single
lease component. A lessee shall not apply this practical expedient to
embedded derivatives that meet the criteria in paragraph 4.3.3 of IFRS 9
Financial Instruments.
Unless the practical expedient in paragraph 15 is applied, a lessee shall
account for non-lease components applying other applicable Standards.
Lessor
For a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional
lease or non-lease components, a lessor shall allocate the consideration in the
contract applying paragraphs 73–90 of IFRS 15.
Lease term (paragraphs B34–B41)
An entity shall determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a
lease, together with both:
(a)
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
(b)
periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is
reasonably certain not to exercise that option.
In assessing whether a lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to
extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, an entity shall
consider all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive for the lessee to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to
exercise the option to terminate the lease, as described in paragraphs
B37–B40.
A lessee shall reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension
option, or not to exercise a termination option, upon the occurrence of either
a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that:
(a)
is within the control of the lessee; and
(b)
affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option
not previously included in its determination of the lease term, or not
to exercise an option previously included in its determination of the
lease term (as described in paragraph B41).
An entity shall revise the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable
period of a lease. For example, the non-cancellable period of a lease will
change if:"

(a)
the lessee exercises an option not previously included in the entity’s
determination of the lease term;
(b)
the lessee does not exercise an option previously included in the
entity’s determination of the lease term;
(c)
an event occurs that contractually obliges the lessee to exercise an
option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the
lease term; or
(d)
an event occurs that contractually prohibits the lessee from exercising
an option previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease
term.
Lessee
Recognition
At the commencement date, a lessee shall recognise a right-of-use asset and a
lease liability.
Measurement
Initial measurement
Initial measurement of the right-of-use asset
At the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset at
cost.
The cost of the right-of-use asset shall comprise:
(a)
the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, as
described in paragraph 26;
(b)
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less
any lease incentives received;
(c)
any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and
(d)
an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and
removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located
or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the
terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to
produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs
either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used
the underlying asset during a particular period.
A lessee shall recognise the costs described in paragraph 24(d) as part of the
cost of the right-of-use asset when it incurs an obligation for those costs. A
lessee applies IAS 2 Inventories to costs that are incurred during a particular
period as a consequence of having used the right-of-use asset to produce
inventories during that period. The obligations for such costs accounted for
applying this Standard or IAS 2 are recognised and measured applying IAS 37
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets."

A825
Initial measurement of the lease liability
At the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the lease liability at the
present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease
payments shall be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if
that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, the lessee shall use the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate.
At the commencement date, the lease payments included in the measurement
of the lease liability comprise the following payments for the right to use
the underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the
commencement date:
(a)
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments as described
in paragraph B42), less any lease incentives receivable;
(b)
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially
measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (as
described in paragraph 28);
(c)
amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value
guarantees;
(d)
the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably
certain to exercise that option (assessed considering the factors
described in paragraphs B37–B40); and
(e)
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.
Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate described in
paragraph 27(b) include, for example, payments linked to a consumer price
index, payments linked to a benchmark interest rate (such as LIBOR) or
payments that vary to reflect changes in market rental rates.
Subsequent measurement
Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset
After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset
applying a cost model, unless it applies either of the measurement models
described in paragraphs 34 and 35.
Cost model
To apply a cost model, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset at cost:
(a)
less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
losses; and
(b)
adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability specified in
paragraph 36(c).
A lessee shall apply the depreciation requirements in IAS 16 Property, Plant and
Equipment in depreciating the right-of-use asset, subject to the requirements in
paragraph 32."

IFRS 16
A826
© IFRS Foundation
If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the
end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the
lessee will exercise a purchase option, the lessee shall depreciate the right-of-
use asset from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the
underlying asset. Otherwise, the lessee shall depreciate the right-of-use asset
from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the
right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.
A lessee shall apply IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to determine whether the right-
of-use asset is impaired and to account for any impairment loss identified.
Other measurement models
If a lessee applies the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property to its
investment property, the lessee shall also apply that fair value model to right-
of-use assets that meet the definition of investment property in IAS 40.
If right-of-use assets relate to a class of property, plant and equipment to
which the lessee applies the revaluation model in IAS 16, a lessee may elect to
apply that revaluation model to all of the right-of-use assets that relate to that
class of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent measurement of the lease liability
After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the lease liability by:
(a)
increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability;
(b)
reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made;
and
(c)
remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or
lease modifications specified in paragraphs 39–46, or to reflect
revised in-substance fixed lease payments (see paragraph B42).
Interest on the lease liability in each period during the lease term shall be the
amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the lease liability. The periodic rate of interest is the discount rate
described in paragraph 26, or if applicable the revised discount rate described
in paragraph 41, paragraph 43 or paragraph 45(c).
After the commencement date, a lessee shall recognise in profit or loss, unless
the costs are included in the carrying amount of another asset applying other
applicable Standards, both:
(a)
interest on the lease liability; and
(b)
variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease
liability in the period in which the event or condition that triggers
those payments occurs."

A827
Reassessment of the lease liability
After the commencement date, a lessee shall apply paragraphs 40–43 to
remeasure the lease liability to reflect changes to the lease payments. A lessee
shall recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an
adjustment to the right-of-use asset. However, if the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the
measurement of the lease liability, a lessee shall recognise any remaining
amount of the remeasurement in profit or loss.
A lessee shall remeasure the lease liability by discounting the revised lease
payments using a revised discount rate, if either:
(a)
there is a change in the lease term, as described in paragraphs 20–21. A
lessee shall determine the revised lease payments on the basis of the
revised lease term; or
(b)
there is a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the
underlying asset, assessed considering the events and circumstances
described in paragraphs 20–21 in the context of a purchase option. A
lessee shall determine the revised lease payments to reflect the change
in amounts payable under the purchase option.
In applying paragraph 40, a lessee shall determine the revised discount rate as
the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of the lease term, if
that rate can be readily determined, or the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate at the date of reassessment, if the interest rate implicit in the lease
cannot be readily determined.
A lessee shall remeasure the lease liability by discounting the revised lease
payments, if either:
(a)
there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a
residual value guarantee. A lessee shall determine the revised lease
payments to reflect the change in amounts expected to be payable
under the residual value guarantee.
(b)
there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in
an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for
example a change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a
market rent review. The lessee shall remeasure the lease liability to
reflect those revised lease payments only when there is a change in the
cash flows (ie when the adjustment to the lease payments takes effect).
A lessee shall determine the revised lease payments for the remainder
of the lease term based on the revised contractual payments.
In applying paragraph 42, a lessee shall use an unchanged discount rate,
unless the change in lease payments results from a change in floating interest
rates. In that case, the lessee shall use a revised discount rate that reflects
changes in the interest rate."

Lease modifications
A lessee shall account for a lease modification as a separate lease if both:
(a)
the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to
use one or more underlying assets; and
(b)
the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate
with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any
appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the
circumstances of the particular contract.
For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, at the
effective date of the lease modification a lessee shall:
(a)
allocate the consideration in the modified contract applying
paragraphs 13–16;
(b)
determine the lease term of the modified lease applying paragraphs
18–19; and
(c)
remeasure the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments
using a revised discount rate. The revised discount rate is determined
as the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of the lease
term, if that rate can be readily determined, or the lessee’s
incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of the modification, if
the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined.
For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the lessee
shall account for the remeasurement of the lease liability by:
(a)
decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the
partial or full termination of the lease for lease modifications that
decrease the scope of the lease. The lessee shall recognise in profit or
loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of the
lease.
(b)
making a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset for all
other lease modifications.
As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a rent
concession that meets the conditions in paragraph 46B is a lease modification.
A lessee that makes this election shall account for any change in lease
payments resulting from the rent concession the same way it would account
for the change applying this Standard if the change were not a lease
modification.
The practical expedient in paragraph 46A applies only to rent concessions
occurring as a direct consequence of the covid-19 pandemic and only if all of
the following conditions are met:
(a)
the change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the
lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration
for the lease immediately preceding the change;"

45,45

IFRS 16
© IFRS Foundation
A829
(b)
any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due
on or before 30 June 2022 (for example, a rent concession would meet
this condition if it results in reduced lease payments on or before"
30,"30 June 2022 and increased lease payments that extend beyond 30 June
2022); and
(c)
there is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the
lease.
Presentation
A lessee shall either present in the statement of financial position, or disclose
in the notes:
(a)
right-of-use assets separately from other assets. If a lessee does not
present right-of-use assets separately in the statement of financial
position, the lessee shall:
(i)
include right-of-use assets within the same line item as that
within which the corresponding underlying assets would be
presented if they were owned; and
(ii)
disclose which line items in the statement of financial position
include those right-of-use assets.
(b)
lease liabilities separately from other liabilities. If the lessee does not
present lease liabilities separately in the statement of financial
position, the lessee shall disclose which line items in the statement of
financial position include those liabilities.
The requirement in paragraph 47(a) does not apply to right-of-use assets that
meet the definition of investment property, which shall be presented in the
statement of financial position as investment property.
In the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, a lessee
shall present interest expense on the lease liability separately from the
depreciation charge for the right-of-use asset. Interest expense on the lease
liability is a component of finance costs, which paragraph 82(b) of IAS 1
Presentation of Financial Statements requires to be presented separately in the
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
In the statement of cash flows, a lessee shall classify:
(a)
cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability within
financing activities;
(b)
cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability applying
the requirements in IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows for interest paid; and
(c)
short-term lease payments, payments for leases of low-value assets and
variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease
liability within operating activities."

Disclosure
The objective of the disclosures is for lessees to disclose information in the
notes that, together with the information provided in the statement of
financial position, statement of profit or loss and statement of cash flows,
gives a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that leases
have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the
lessee. Paragraphs 52–60 specify requirements on how to meet this
objective.
A lessee shall disclose information about its leases for which it is a lessee in a
single note or separate section in its financial statements. However, a lessee
need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere in the
financial statements, provided that the information is incorporated by cross-
reference in the single note or separate section about leases.
A lessee shall disclose the following amounts for the reporting period:
(a)
depreciation charge for right-of-use assets by class of underlying asset;
(b)
interest expense on lease liabilities;
(c)
the expense relating to short-term leases accounted for applying
paragraph 6. This expense need not include the expense relating to
leases with a lease term of one month or less;
(d)
the expense relating to leases of low-value assets accounted for
applying paragraph 6. This expense shall not include the expense
relating to short-term leases of low-value assets included in
paragraph 53(c);
(e)
the expense relating to variable lease payments not included in the
measurement of lease liabilities;
(f)
income from subleasing right-of-use assets;
(g)
total cash outflow for leases;
(h)
additions to right-of-use assets;
(i)
gains or losses arising from sale and leaseback transactions; and
(j)
the carrying amount of right-of-use assets at the end of the reporting
period by class of underlying asset.
A lessee shall provide the disclosures specified in paragraph 53 in a tabular
format, unless another format is more appropriate. The amounts disclosed
shall include costs that a lessee has included in the carrying amount of
another asset during the reporting period.
A lessee shall disclose the amount of its lease commitments for short-term
leases accounted for applying paragraph 6 if the portfolio of short-term leases
to which it is committed at the end of the reporting period is dissimilar to the
portfolio of short-term leases to which the short-term lease expense disclosed
applying paragraph 53(c) relates."

If right-of-use assets meet the definition of investment property, a lessee shall
apply the disclosure requirements in IAS 40. In that case, a lessee is not
required to provide the disclosures in paragraph 53(a), (f), (h) or (j) for those
right-of-use assets.
If a lessee measures right-of-use assets at revalued amounts applying IAS 16,
the lessee shall disclose the information required by paragraph 77 of IAS 16
for those right-of-use assets.
A lessee shall disclose a maturity analysis of lease liabilities applying
paragraphs 39 and B11 of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures separately
from the maturity analyses of other financial liabilities.
In addition to the disclosures required in paragraphs 53–58, a lessee shall
disclose additional qualitative and quantitative information about its leasing
activities necessary to meet the disclosure objective in paragraph 51 (as
described in paragraph B48). This additional information may include, but is
not limited to, information that helps users of financial statements to assess:
(a)
the nature of the lessee’s leasing activities;
(b)
future cash outflows to which the lessee is potentially exposed that are
not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. This includes
exposure arising from:
(i)
variable lease payments (as described in paragraph B49);
(ii)
extension options and termination options (as described in
paragraph B50);
(iii)
residual value guarantees (as described in paragraph B51); and
(iv)
leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed.
(c)
restrictions or covenants imposed by leases; and
(d)
sale and leaseback transactions (as described in paragraph B52).
A lessee that accounts for short-term leases or leases of low-value assets
applying paragraph 6 shall disclose that fact.
If a lessee applies the practical expedient in paragraph 46A, the lessee shall
disclose:
(a)
that it has applied the practical expedient to all rent concessions that
meet the conditions in paragraph 46B or, if not applied to all such rent
concessions, information about the nature of the contracts to which it
has applied the practical expedient (see paragraph 2); and
(b)
the amount recognised in profit or loss for the reporting period to
reflect changes in lease payments that arise from rent concessions to
which the lessee has applied the practical expedient in paragraph 46A."

Classification of leases (paragraphs B53–B58)
A lessor shall classify each of its leases as either an operating lease or a
finance lease.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset. A lease is
classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.
Whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the
substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contract. Examples of
situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease
being classified as a finance lease are:
(a)
the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by
the end of the lease term;
(b)
the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset at a price
that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the date
the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain, at the
inception date, that the option will be exercised;
(c)
the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the
underlying asset even if title is not transferred;
(d)
at the inception date, the present value of the lease payments amounts
to at least substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset; and
(e)
the underlying asset is of such a specialised nature that only the lessee
can use it without major modifications.
Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a
lease being classified as a finance lease are:
(a)
if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor’s losses associated with the
cancellation are borne by the lessee;
(b)
gains or losses from the fluctuation in the fair value of the residual
accrue to the lessee (for example, in the form of a rent rebate equaling
most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease); and
(c)
the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at
a rent that is substantially lower than market rent.
The examples and indicators in paragraphs 63–64 are not always conclusive. If
it is clear from other features that the lease does not transfer substantially all
the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset, the lease
is classified as an operating lease. For example, this may be the case if
ownership of the underlying asset transfers at the end of the lease for a
variable payment equal to its then fair value, or if there are variable lease
payments, as a result of which the lessor does not transfer substantially all
such risks and rewards."

Lease classification is made at the inception date and is reassessed only if
there is a lease modification. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in
estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the underlying asset),
or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee), do not give
rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.
Finance leases
Recognition and measurement
At the commencement date, a lessor shall recognise assets held under a
finance lease in its statement of financial position and present them as a
receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
Initial measurement
The lessor shall use the interest rate implicit in the lease to measure the net
investment in the lease. In the case of a sublease, if the interest rate implicit
in the sublease cannot be readily determined, an intermediate lessor may use
the discount rate used for the head lease (adjusted for any initial direct costs
associated with the sublease) to measure the net investment in the sublease.
Initial direct costs, other than those incurred by manufacturer or dealer
lessors, are included in the initial measurement of the net investment in the
lease and reduce the amount of income recognised over the lease term. The
interest rate implicit in the lease is defined in such a way that the initial direct
costs are included automatically in the net investment in the lease; there is no
need to add them separately.
Initial measurement of the lease payments included in the net investment
in the lease
At the commencement date, the lease payments included in the measurement
of the net investment in the lease comprise the following payments for the
right to use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not received at
the commencement date:
(a)
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments as described in
paragraph B42), less any lease incentives payable;
(b)
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially
measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
(c)
any residual value guarantees provided to the lessor by the lessee, a
party related to the lessee or a third party unrelated to the lessor that
is financially capable of discharging the obligations under the
guarantee;
(d)
the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably
certain to exercise that option (assessed considering the factors
described in paragraph B37); and
(e)
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease."

Manufacturer or dealer lessors
At the commencement date, a manufacturer or dealer lessor shall recognise
the following for each of its finance leases:
(a)
revenue being the fair value of the underlying asset, or, if lower, the
present value of the lease payments accruing to the lessor, discounted
using a market rate of interest;
(b)
the cost of sale being the cost, or carrying amount if different, of the
underlying asset less the present value of the unguaranteed residual
value; and
(c)
selling profit or loss (being the difference between revenue and the
cost of sale) in accordance with its policy for outright sales to which
IFRS 15 applies. A manufacturer or dealer lessor shall recognise selling
profit or loss on a finance lease at the commencement date, regardless
of whether the lessor transfers the underlying asset as described in
IFRS 15.
Manufacturers or dealers often offer to customers the choice of either buying
or leasing an asset. A finance lease of an asset by a manufacturer or dealer
lessor gives rise to profit or loss equivalent to the profit or loss resulting from
an outright sale of the underlying asset, at normal selling prices, reflecting
any applicable volume or trade discounts.
Manufacturer or dealer lessors sometimes quote artificially low rates of
interest in order to attract customers. The use of such a rate would result in a
lessor recognising an excessive portion of the total income from the
transaction at the commencement date. If artificially low rates of interest are
quoted, a manufacturer or dealer lessor shall restrict selling profit to that
which would apply if a market rate of interest were charged.
A manufacturer or dealer lessor shall recognise as an expense costs incurred
in connection with obtaining a finance lease at the commencement date
because they are mainly related to earning the manufacturer or dealer’s
selling profit. Costs incurred by manufacturer or dealer lessors in connection
with obtaining a finance lease are excluded from the definition of initial direct
costs and, thus, are excluded from the net investment in the lease.
Subsequent measurement
A lessor shall recognise finance income over the lease term, based on a
pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net
investment in the lease.
A lessor aims to allocate finance income over the lease term on a systematic
and rational basis. A lessor shall apply the lease payments relating to the
period against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and
the unearned finance income."

A lessor shall apply the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9
to the net investment in the lease. A lessor shall review regularly estimated
unguaranteed residual values used in computing the gross investment in the
lease. If there has been a reduction in the estimated unguaranteed residual
value, the lessor shall revise the income allocation over the lease term and
recognise immediately any reduction in respect of amounts accrued.
A lessor that classifies an asset under a finance lease as held for sale (or
includes it in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) applying IFRS 5
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations shall account for the
asset in accordance with that Standard.
Lease modifications
A lessor shall account for a modification to a finance lease as a separate lease
if both:
(a)
the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to
use one or more underlying assets; and
(b)
the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate
with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any
appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the
circumstances of the particular contract.
For a modification to a finance lease that is not accounted for as a separate
lease, a lessor shall account for the modification as follows:
(a)
if the lease would have been classified as an operating lease had the
modification been in effect at the inception date, the lessor shall:
(i)
account for the lease modification as a new lease from the
effective date of the modification; and
(ii)
measure the carrying amount of the underlying asset as the net
investment in the lease immediately before the effective date of
the lease modification.
(b)
otherwise, the lessor shall apply the requirements of IFRS 9.
Operating leases
Recognition and measurement
A lessor shall recognise lease payments from operating leases as income on
either a straight-line basis or another systematic basis. The lessor shall
apply another systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the
pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is
diminished.
A lessor shall recognise costs, including depreciation, incurred in earning the
lease income as an expense."

A lessor shall add initial direct costs incurred in obtaining an operating lease
to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognise those costs as an
expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.
The depreciation policy for depreciable underlying assets subject to operating
leases shall be consistent with the lessor’s normal depreciation policy for
similar assets. A lessor shall calculate depreciation in accordance with IAS 16
and IAS 38.
A lessor shall apply IAS 36 to determine whether an underlying asset subject
to an operating lease is impaired and to account for any impairment loss
identified.
A manufacturer or dealer lessor does not recognise any selling profit on
entering into an operating lease because it is not the equivalent of a sale.
Lease modifications
A lessor shall account for a modification to an operating lease as a new lease
from the effective date of the modification, considering any prepaid or
accrued lease payments relating to the original lease as part of the lease
payments for the new lease.
Presentation
A lessor shall present underlying assets subject to operating leases in its
statement of financial position according to the nature of the underlying
asset.
Disclosure
The objective of the disclosures is for lessors to disclose information in the
notes that, together with the information provided in the statement of
financial position, statement of profit or loss and statement of cash flows,
gives a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that leases
have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the
lessor. Paragraphs 90–97 specify requirements on how to meet this
objective.
A lessor shall disclose the following amounts for the reporting period:
(a)
for finance leases:
(i)
selling profit or loss;
(ii)
finance income on the net investment in the lease; and
(iii)
income relating to variable lease payments not included in the
measurement of the net investment in the lease.
(b)
for operating leases, lease income, separately disclosing income
relating to variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a
rate.
A lessor shall provide the disclosures specified in paragraph 90 in a tabular
format, unless another format is more appropriate."

A lessor shall disclose additional qualitative and quantitative information
about its leasing activities necessary to meet the disclosure objective
in paragraph 89. This additional information includes, but is not limited to,
information that helps users of financial statements to assess:
(a)
the nature of the lessor’s leasing activities; and
(b)
how the lessor manages the risk associated with any rights it retains
in underlying assets. In particular, a lessor shall disclose its risk
management strategy for the rights it retains in underlying assets,
including any means by which the lessor reduces that risk. Such
means may include, for example, buy-back agreements, residual value
guarantees or variable lease payments for use in excess of specified
limits.
Finance leases
A lessor shall provide a qualitative and quantitative explanation of the
significant changes in the carrying amount of the net investment in finance
leases.
A lessor shall disclose a maturity analysis of the lease payments receivable,
showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received on an annual basis
for a minimum of each of the first five years and a total of the amounts for
the remaining years. A lessor shall reconcile the undiscounted lease payments
to the net investment in the lease. The reconciliation shall identify the
unearned finance income relating to the lease payments receivable and any
discounted unguaranteed residual value.
Operating leases
For items of property, plant and equipment subject to an operating lease, a
lessor shall apply the disclosure requirements of IAS 16. In applying the
disclosure requirements in IAS 16, a lessor shall disaggregate each class of
property, plant and equipment into assets subject to operating leases and
assets not subject to operating leases. Accordingly, a lessor shall provide the
disclosures required by IAS 16 for assets subject to an operating lease (by class
of underlying asset) separately from owned assets held and used by the lessor.
A lessor shall apply the disclosure requirements in IAS 36, IAS 38, IAS 40 and
IAS 41 for assets subject to operating leases.
A lessor shall disclose a maturity analysis of lease payments, showing the
undiscounted lease payments to be received on an annual basis for a
minimum of each of the first five years and a total of the amounts for the
remaining years.
Sale and leaseback transactions
If an entity (the seller-lessee) transfers an asset to another entity (the buyer-
lessor) and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor, both the seller-lessee
and the buyer-lessor shall account for the transfer contract and
the lease applying paragraphs 99–103."

Assessing whether the transfer of the asset is a sale
An entity shall apply the requirements for determining when a performance
obligation is satisfied in IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset
is accounted for as a sale of that asset.
Transfer of the asset is a sale
If the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee satisfies the requirements of
IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset:
(a)
the seller-lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset arising from the
leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the
asset that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee.
Accordingly, the seller-lessee shall recognise only the amount of any
gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.
(b)
the buyer-lessor shall account for the purchase of the asset applying
applicable Standards, and for the lease applying the lessor accounting
requirements in this Standard.
If the fair value of the consideration for the sale of an asset does not equal the
fair value of the asset, or if the payments for the lease are not at market rates,
an entity shall make the following adjustments to measure the sale proceeds
at fair value:
(a)
any below-market terms shall be accounted for as a prepayment of
lease payments; and
(b)
any above-market terms shall be accounted for as additional financing
provided by the buyer-lessor to the seller-lessee.
The entity shall measure any potential adjustment required by paragraph 101
on the basis of the more readily determinable of:
(a)
the difference between the fair value of the consideration for the sale
and the fair value of the asset; and
(b)
the difference between the present value of the contractual payments
for the lease and the present value of payments for the lease at market
rates.
After the commencement date, the seller-lessee shall apply paragraphs 29–35
to the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback and paragraphs 36–46 to
the lease liability arising from the leaseback. In applying paragraphs 36–46,
the seller-lessee shall determine ‘lease payments’ or ‘revised lease payments’
in a way that the seller-lessee would not recognise any amount of the gain or
loss that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. Applying the
requirements in this paragraph does not prevent the seller-lessee from
recognising in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full
termination of a lease as required by paragraph 46(a)."

Transfer of the asset is not a sale
If the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee does not satisfy the requirements
of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset:
(a)
the seller-lessee shall continue to recognise the transferred asset and
shall recognise a financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds. It
shall account for the financial liability applying IFRS 9.
(b)
the buyer-lessor shall not recognise the transferred asset and shall
recognise a financial asset equal to the transfer proceeds. It shall
account for the financial asset applying IFRS 9.
Temporary exception arising from interest rate benchmark reform
A lessee shall apply paragraphs 105–106 to all lease modifications that change
the basis for determining future lease payments as a result of interest rate
benchmark reform (see paragraphs 5.4.6 and 5.4.8 of IFRS 9). These
paragraphs apply only to such lease modifications. For this purpose, the term
‘interest rate benchmark reform’ refers to the market-wide reform of an
interest rate benchmark as described in paragraph 6.8.2 of IFRS 9.
As a practical expedient, a lessee shall apply paragraph 42 to account for a
lease modification required by interest rate benchmark reform. This practical
expedient applies only to such modifications. For this purpose, a lease
modification is required by interest rate benchmark reform if, and only if,
both of these conditions are met:
(a)
the modification is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate
benchmark reform; and
(b)
the new basis for determining the lease payments is economically
equivalent to the previous basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the
modification).
However, if lease modifications are made in addition to those lease
modifications required by interest rate benchmark reform, a lessee shall apply
the applicable requirements in this Standard to account for all lease
modifications made at the same time, including those required by interest
rate benchmark reform."

Appendix B,"Appendix B
Application guidance
This appendix is an integral part of the Standard. It describes the application of paragraphs 1–103
and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.
Portfolio application
This Standard specifies the accounting for an individual lease. However, as a
practical expedient, an entity may apply this Standard to a portfolio of leases
with similar characteristics if the entity reasonably expects that the effects on
the financial statements of applying this Standard to the portfolio would not
differ materially from applying this Standard to the individual leases within
that portfolio. If accounting for a portfolio, an entity shall use estimates and
assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio.
Combination of contracts
In applying this Standard, an entity shall combine two or more contracts
entered into at or near the same time with the same counterparty (or related
parties of the counterparty), and account for the contracts as a single contract
if one or more of the following criteria are met:
(a)
the contracts are negotiated as a package with an overall commercial
objective that cannot be understood without considering the contracts
together;
(b)
the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the
price or performance of the other contract; or
(c)
the rights to use underlying assets conveyed in the contracts (or some
rights to use underlying assets conveyed in each of the contracts) form
a single lease component as described in paragraph B32.
Recognition exemption: leases for which the underlying
asset is of low value (paragraphs 5–8)
Except as specified in paragraph B7, this Standard permits a lessee to apply
paragraph 6 to account for leases for which the underlying asset is of low
value. A lessee shall assess the value of an underlying asset based on the value
of the asset when it is new, regardless of the age of the asset being leased.
The assessment of whether an underlying asset is of low value is performed on
an absolute basis. Leases of low-value assets qualify for the accounting
treatment in paragraph 6 regardless of whether those leases are material to
the lessee. The assessment is not affected by the size, nature or circumstances
of the lessee. Accordingly, different lessees are expected to reach the same
conclusions about whether a particular underlying asset is of low value.
B1
B2
B3
B4
IFRS 16
© IFRS Foundation
A845
An underlying asset can be of low value only if:
(a)
the lessee can benefit from use of the underlying asset on its own or
together with other resources that are readily available to the lessee;
and
(b)
the underlying asset is not highly dependent on, or highly interrelated
with, other assets.
A lease of an underlying asset does not qualify as a lease of a low-value asset if
the nature of the asset is such that, when new, the asset is typically not of low
value. For example, leases of cars would not qualify as leases of low-value
assets because a new car would typically not be of low value.
If a lessee subleases an asset, or expects to sublease an asset, the head lease
does not qualify as a lease of a low-value asset.
Examples of low-value underlying assets can include tablet and personal
computers, small items of office furniture and telephones.
Identifying a lease (paragraphs 9–11)
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an
identified asset (see paragraphs B13–B20) for a period of time, an entity shall
assess whether, throughout the period of use, the customer has both of the
following:
(a)
the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use
of the identified asset (as described in paragraphs B21–B23); and
(b)
the right to direct the use of the identified asset (as described in
paragraphs B24–B30).
If the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for only a
portion of the term of the contract, the contract contains a lease for that
portion of the term.
A contract to receive goods or services may be entered into by a joint
arrangement, or on behalf of a joint arrangement, as defined in IFRS 11 Joint
Arrangements. In this case, the joint arrangement is considered to be the
customer in the contract. Accordingly, in assessing whether such a contract
contains a lease, an entity shall assess whether the joint arrangement has the
right to control the use of an identified asset throughout the period of use.
An entity shall assess whether a contract contains a lease for each potential
separate lease component. Refer to paragraph B32 for guidance on separate
lease components.
Identified asset
An asset is typically identified by being explicitly specified in a contract.
However, an asset can also be identified by being implicitly specified at the
time that the asset is made available for use by the customer.

Substantive substitution rights
Even if an asset is specified, a customer does not have the right to use an
identified asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset
throughout the period of use. A supplier’s right to substitute an asset is
substantive only if both of the following conditions exist:
(a)
the supplier has the practical ability to substitute alternative assets
throughout the period of use (for example, the customer cannot
prevent the supplier from substituting the asset and alternative assets
are readily available to the supplier or could be sourced by the supplier
within a reasonable period of time); and
(b)
the supplier would benefit economically from the exercise of its right
to substitute the asset (ie the economic benefits associated with
substituting the asset are expected to exceed the costs associated with
substituting the asset).
If the supplier has a right or an obligation to substitute the asset only on or
after either a particular date or the occurrence of a specified event, the
supplier’s substitution right is not substantive because the supplier does not
have the practical ability to substitute alternative assets throughout the
period of use.
An entity’s evaluation of whether a supplier’s substitution right is substantive
is based on facts and circumstances at inception of the contract and shall
exclude consideration of future events that, at inception of the contract, are
not considered likely to occur. Examples of future events that, at inception of
the contract, would not be considered likely to occur and, thus, should be
excluded from the evaluation include:
(a)
an agreement by a future customer to pay an above market rate for use
of the asset;
(b)
the introduction of new technology that is not substantially developed
at inception of the contract;
(c)
a substantial difference between the customer’s use of the asset, or the
performance of the asset, and the use or performance considered likely
at inception of the contract; and
(d)
a substantial difference between the market price of the asset during
the period of use, and the market price considered likely at inception
of the contract.
If the asset is located at the customer’s premises or elsewhere, the costs
associated with substitution are generally higher than when located at the
supplier’s premises and, therefore, are more likely to exceed the benefits
associated with substituting the asset.
The supplier’s right or obligation to substitute the asset for repairs and
maintenance, if the asset is not operating properly or if a technical upgrade
becomes available does not preclude the customer from having the right to
use an identified asset.

If the customer cannot readily determine whether the supplier has a
substantive substitution right, the customer shall presume that any
substitution right is not substantive.
Portions of assets
A capacity portion of an asset is an identified asset if it is physically distinct
(for example, a floor of a building). A capacity or other portion of an asset that
is not physically distinct (for example, a capacity portion of a fibre optic cable)
is not an identified asset, unless it represents substantially all of the capacity
of the asset and thereby provides the customer with the right to obtain
substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset.
Right to obtain economic benefits from use
To control the use of an identified asset, a customer is required to have the
right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset
throughout the period of use (for example, by having exclusive use of the asset
throughout that period). A customer can obtain economic benefits from use of
an asset directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by using, holding or sub-
leasing the asset. The economic benefits from use of an asset include its
primary output and by-products (including potential cash flows derived from
these items), and other economic benefits from using the asset that could be
realised from a commercial transaction with a third party.
When assessing the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits
from use of an asset, an entity shall consider the economic benefits that result
from use of the asset within the defined scope of a customer’s right to use the
asset (see paragraph B30). For example:
(a)
if a contract limits the use of a motor vehicle to only one particular
territory during the period of use, an entity shall consider only the
economic benefits from use of the motor vehicle within that territory,
and not beyond.
(b)
if a contract specifies that a customer can drive a motor vehicle only
up to a particular number of miles during the period of use, an entity
shall consider only the economic benefits from use of the motor
vehicle for the permitted mileage, and not beyond.
If a contract requires a customer to pay the supplier or another party a
portion of the cash flows derived from use of an asset as consideration, those
cash flows paid as consideration shall be considered to be part of the economic
benefits that the customer obtains from use of the asset. For example, if the
customer is required to pay the supplier a percentage of sales from use of
retail space as consideration for that use, that requirement does not prevent
the customer from having the right to obtain substantially all of the economic
benefits from use of the retail space. This is because the cash flows arising
from those sales are considered to be economic benefits that the customer
obtains from use of the retail space, a portion of which it then pays to the
supplier as consideration for the right to use that space.

Right to direct the use
A customer has the right to direct the use of an identified asset throughout
the period of use only if either:
(a)
the customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the
asset is used throughout the period of use (as described in paragraphs
B25–B30); or
(b)
the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is
used are predetermined and:
(i)
the customer has the right to operate the asset (or to direct
others to operate the asset in a manner that it determines)
throughout the period of use, without the supplier having the
right to change those operating instructions; or
(ii)
the customer designed the asset (or specific aspects of the asset)
in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the
asset will be used throughout the period of use.
How and for what purpose the asset is used
A customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used
if, within the scope of its right of use defined in the contract, it can change
how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use. In
making this assessment, an entity considers the decision-making rights that
are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used
throughout the period of use. Decision-making rights are relevant when they
affect the economic benefits to be derived from use. The decision-making
rights that are most relevant are likely to be different for different contracts,
depending on the nature of the asset and the terms and conditions of the
contract.
Examples of decision-making rights that, depending on the circumstances,
grant the right to change how and for what purpose the asset is used, within
the defined scope of the customer’s right of use, include:
(a)
rights to change the type of output that is produced by the asset
(for example, to decide whether to use a shipping container to
transport goods or for storage, or to decide upon the mix of products
sold from retail space);
(b)
rights to change when the output is produced (for example, to decide
when an item of machinery or a power plant will be used);
(c)
rights to change where the output is produced (for example, to decide
upon the destination of a truck or a ship, or to decide where an item of
equipment is used); and
(d)
rights to change whether the output is produced, and the quantity of
that output (for example, to decide whether to produce energy from a
power plant and how much energy to produce from that power plant).
B24
B25
B26
IFRS 16
© IFRS Foundation
A849
Examples of decision-making rights that do not grant the right to change how
and for what purpose the asset is used include rights that are limited to
operating or maintaining the asset. Such rights can be held by the customer or
the supplier. Although rights such as those to operate or maintain an asset are
often essential to the efficient use of an asset, they are not rights to direct how
and for what purpose the asset is used and are often dependent on the
decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used. However, rights
to operate an asset may grant the customer the right to direct the use of the
asset if the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is
used are predetermined (see paragraph B24(b)(i)).
Decisions determined during and before the period of use
The relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used can
be predetermined in a number of ways. For example, the relevant decisions
can be predetermined by the design of the asset or by contractual restrictions
on the use of the asset.
In assessing whether a customer has the right to direct the use of an asset, an
entity shall consider only rights to make decisions about the use of the asset
during the period of use, unless the customer designed the asset (or specific
aspects of the asset) as described in paragraph B24(b)(ii). Consequently, unless
the conditions in paragraph B24(b)(ii) exist, an entity shall not consider
decisions that are predetermined before the period of use. For example, if a
customer is able only to specify the output of an asset before the period of use,
the customer does not have the right to direct the use of that asset. The ability
to specify the output in a contract before the period of use, without any other
decision-making rights relating to the use of the asset, gives a customer the
same rights as any customer that purchases goods or services.
Protective rights
A contract may include terms and conditions designed to protect the
supplier’s interest in the asset or other assets, to protect its personnel, or to
ensure the supplier’s compliance with laws or regulations. These are examples
of protective rights. For example, a contract may (i) specify the maximum
amount of use of an asset or limit where or when the customer can use the
asset, (ii) require a customer to follow particular operating practices, or (iii)
require a customer to inform the supplier of changes in how an asset will be
used. Protective rights typically define the scope of the customer’s right of use
but do not, in isolation, prevent the customer from having the right to direct
the use of an asset.

Separating components of a contract (paragraphs 12–17)
The right to use an underlying asset is a separate lease component if both:
(a)
the lessee can benefit from use of the underlying asset either on its
own or together with other resources that are readily available to the
lessee. Readily available resources are goods or services that are sold or
leased separately (by the lessor or other suppliers) or resources that the
lessee has already obtained (from the lessor or from other transactions
or events); and
(b)
the underlying asset is neither highly dependent on, nor highly
interrelated with, the other underlying assets in the contract. For
example, the fact that a lessee could decide not to lease the underlying
asset without significantly affecting its rights to use other underlying
B31
B32
IFRS 16
© IFRS Foundation
A851
assets in the contract might indicate that the underlying asset is not
highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, those other
underlying assets.
A contract may include an amount payable by the lessee for activities and
costs that do not transfer a good or service to the lessee. For example, a lessor
may include in the total amount payable a charge for administrative tasks, or
other costs it incurs associated with the lease, that do not transfer a good or
service to the lessee. Such amounts payable do not give rise to a separate
component of the contract, but are considered to be part of the total
consideration that is allocated to the separately identified components of the
contract.
Lease term (paragraphs 18–21)
In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable
period of a lease, an entity shall apply the definition of a contract and
determine the period for which the contract is enforceable. A lease is no
longer enforceable when the lessee and the lessor each has the right to
terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more
than an insignificant penalty.
If only a lessee has the right to terminate a lease, that right is considered to be
an option to terminate the lease available to the lessee that an entity considers
when determining the lease term. If only a lessor has the right to terminate a
lease, the non-cancellable period of the lease includes the period covered by
the option to terminate the lease.
The lease term begins at the commencement date and includes any rent-free
periods provided to the lessee by the lessor.
At the commencement date, an entity assesses whether the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or to purchase the
underlying asset, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The
entity considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive for the lessee to exercise, or not to exercise, the option, including
any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement
date until the exercise date of the option. Examples of factors to consider
include, but are not limited to:
(a)
contractual terms and conditions for the optional periods compared
with market rates, such as:
(i)
the amount of payments for the lease in any optional period;
(ii)
the amount of any variable payments for the lease or other
contingent payments, such as payments resulting from
termination penalties and residual value guarantees; and
(iii)
the terms and conditions of any options that are exercisable
after initial optional periods (for example, a purchase option
that is exercisable at the end of an extension period at a rate
that is currently below market rates).
B33
B34
B35
B36
B37
IFRS 16
A852
© IFRS Foundation
(b)
significant leasehold improvements undertaken (or expected to be
undertaken) over the term of the contract that are expected to have
significant economic benefit for the lessee when the option to extend
or terminate the lease, or to purchase the underlying asset, becomes
exercisable;
(c)
costs relating to the termination of the lease, such as negotiation costs,
relocation costs, costs of identifying another underlying asset suitable
for the lessee’s needs, costs of integrating a new asset into the lessee’s
operations, or termination penalties and similar costs, including costs
associated with returning the underlying asset in a contractually
specified condition or to a contractually specified location;
(d)
the importance of that underlying asset to the lessee’s operations,
considering, for example, whether the underlying asset is a specialised
asset, the location of the underlying asset and the availability of
suitable alternatives; and
(e)
conditionality associated with exercising the option (ie when the
option can be exercised only if one or more conditions are met), and
the likelihood that those conditions will exist.
An option to extend or terminate a lease may be combined with one or more
other contractual features (for example, a residual value guarantee) such that
the lessee guarantees the lessor a minimum or fixed cash return that is
substantially the same regardless of whether the option is exercised. In such
cases, and notwithstanding the guidance on in-substance fixed payments in
paragraph B42, an entity shall assume that the lessee is reasonably certain to
exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to
terminate the lease.
The shorter the non-cancellable period of a lease, the more likely a lessee is to
exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate
the lease. This is because the costs associated with obtaining a replacement
asset are likely to be proportionately higher the shorter the non-cancellable
period.
A lessee’s past practice regarding the period over which it has typically used
particular types of assets (whether leased or owned), and its economic reasons
for doing so, may provide information that is helpful in assessing whether the
lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, or not to exercise, an option. For
example, if a lessee has typically used particular types of assets for a particular
period of time or if the lessee has a practice of frequently exercising options
on leases of particular types of underlying assets, the lessee shall consider the
economic reasons for that past practice in assessing whether it is reasonably
certain to exercise an option on leases of those assets.
Paragraph 20 specifies that, after the commencement date, a lessee reassesses
the lease term upon the occurrence of a significant event or a significant
change in circumstances that is within the control of the lessee and affects
whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously
included in its determination of the lease term, or not to exercise an option
B38
B39

A853
previously included in its determination of the lease term. Examples of
significant events or changes in circumstances include:
(a)
significant 
leasehold 
improvements 
not 
anticipated 
at 
the
commencement date that are expected to have significant economic
benefit for the lessee when the option to extend or terminate the lease,
or to purchase the underlying asset, becomes exercisable;
(b)
a significant modification to, or customisation of, the underlying asset
that was not anticipated at the commencement date;
(c)
the inception of a sublease of the underlying asset for a period beyond
the end of the previously determined lease term; and
(d)
a business decision of the lessee that is directly relevant to exercising,
or not exercising, an option (for example, a decision to extend the lease
of a complementary asset, to dispose of an alternative asset or to
dispose of a business unit within which the right-of-use asset is
employed).
In-substance fixed lease payments (paragraphs 27(a),
36(c) and 70(a))
Lease payments include any in-substance fixed lease payments. In-substance
fixed lease payments are payments that may, in form, contain variability but
that, in substance, are unavoidable. In-substance fixed lease payments exist,
for example, if:
(a)
payments are structured as variable lease payments, but there is no
genuine variability in those payments. Those payments contain
variable clauses that do not have real economic substance. Examples of
those types of payments include:
(i)
payments that must be made only if an asset is proven to be
capable of operating during the lease, or only if an event occurs
that has no genuine possibility of not occurring; or
(ii)
payments that are initially structured as variable lease
payments linked to the use of the underlying asset but for
which the variability will be resolved at some point after the
commencement date so that the payments become fixed for the
remainder of the lease term. Those payments become in-
substance fixed payments when the variability is resolved.
(b)
there is more than one set of payments that a lessee could make, but
only one of those sets of payments is realistic. In this case, an entity
shall consider the realistic set of payments to be lease payments.
(c)
there is more than one realistic set of payments that a lessee could
make, but it must make at least one of those sets of payments. In this
case, an entity shall consider the set of payments that aggregates to the
lowest amount (on a discounted basis) to be lease payments.
B42
IFRS 16

Lessee involvement with the underlying asset before the
commencement date
Costs of the lessee relating to the construction or design of the
underlying asset
An entity may negotiate a lease before the underlying asset is available for use
by the lessee. For some leases, the underlying asset may need to be
constructed or redesigned for use by the lessee. Depending on the terms and
conditions of the contract, a lessee may be required to make payments
relating to the construction or design of the asset.
If a lessee incurs costs relating to the construction or design of an underlying
asset, the lessee shall account for those costs applying other applicable
Standards, such as IAS 16. Costs relating to the construction or design of an
underlying asset do not include payments made by the lessee for the right to
use the underlying asset. Payments for the right to use an underlying asset are
payments for a lease, regardless of the timing of those payments.
Legal title to the underlying asset
A lessee may obtain legal title to an underlying asset before that legal title is
transferred to the lessor and the asset is leased to the lessee. Obtaining legal
title does not in itself determine how to account for the transaction.
If the lessee controls (or obtains control of) the underlying asset before that
asset is transferred to the lessor, the transaction is a sale and leaseback
transaction that is accounted for applying paragraphs 98–103.
However, if the lessee does not obtain control of the underlying asset before
the asset is transferred to the lessor, the transaction is not a sale and
leaseback transaction. For example, this may be the case if a manufacturer, a
lessor and a lessee negotiate a transaction for the purchase of an asset from
the manufacturer by the lessor, which is in turn leased to the lessee. The
lessee may obtain legal title to the underlying asset before legal title transfers
to the lessor. In this case, if the lessee obtains legal title to the underlying
asset but does not obtain control of the asset before it is transferred to the
lessor, the transaction is not accounted for as a sale and leaseback transaction,
but as a lease.
Lessee disclosures (paragraph 59)
In determining whether additional information about leasing activities is
necessary to meet the disclosure objective in paragraph 51, a lessee shall
consider:
(a)
whether that information is relevant to users of financial statements.
A lessee shall provide additional information specified in paragraph 59
only if that information is expected to be relevant to users of financial
statements. In this context, this is likely to be the case if it helps those
users to understand:
B43
B44
B45

A855
(i)
the flexibility provided by leases. Leases may provide flexibility
if, for example, a lessee can reduce its exposure by exercising
termination options or renewing leases with favourable terms
and conditions.
(ii)
restrictions imposed by leases. Leases may impose restrictions,
for example, by requiring the lessee to maintain particular
financial ratios.
(iii)
sensitivity of reported information to key variables. Reported
information may be sensitive to, for example, future variable
lease payments.
(iv)
exposure to other risks arising from leases.
(v)
deviations from industry practice. Such deviations may include,
for example, unusual or unique lease terms and conditions that
affect a lessee’s lease portfolio.
(b)
whether that information is apparent from information either
presented in the primary financial statements or disclosed in the notes.
A lessee need not duplicate information that is already presented
elsewhere in the financial statements.
Additional information relating to variable lease payments that, depending on
the circumstances, may be needed to satisfy the disclosure objective in
paragraph 51 could include information that helps users of financial
statements to assess, for example:
(a)
the lessee’s reasons for using variable lease payments and the
prevalence of those payments;
(b)
the relative magnitude of variable lease payments to fixed payments;
(c)
key variables upon which variable lease payments depend and how
payments are expected to vary in response to changes in those key
variables; and
(d)
other operational and financial effects of variable lease payments.
Additional information relating to extension options or termination options
that, depending on the circumstances, may be needed to satisfy the disclosure
objective in paragraph 51 could include information that helps users of
financial statements to assess, for example:
(a)
the lessee’s reasons for using extension options or termination options
and the prevalence of those options;
(b)
the relative magnitude of optional lease payments to lease payments;
(c)
the prevalence of the exercise of options that were not included in the
measurement of lease liabilities; and
(d)
other operational and financial effects of those options.
B49

Additional information relating to residual value guarantees that, depending
on the circumstances, may be needed to satisfy the disclosure objective in
paragraph 51 could include information that helps users of financial
statements to assess, for example:
(a)
the lessee’s reasons for providing residual value guarantees and the
prevalence of those guarantees;
(b)
the magnitude of a lessee’s exposure to residual value risk;
(c)
the nature of underlying assets for which those guarantees are
provided; and
(d)
other operational and financial effects of those guarantees.
Additional information relating to sale and leaseback transactions that,
depending on the circumstances, may be needed to satisfy the disclosure
objective in paragraph 51 could include information that helps users of
financial statements to assess, for example:
(a)
the lessee’s reasons for sale and leaseback transactions and the
prevalence of those transactions;
(b)
key terms and conditions of individual sale and leaseback transactions;
(c)
payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities; and
(d)
the cash flow effect of sale and leaseback transactions in the reporting
period.
Lessor lease classification (paragraphs 61–66)
The classification of leases for lessors in this Standard is based on the extent to
which the lease transfers the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an
underlying asset. Risks include the possibilities of losses from idle capacity or
technological obsolescence and of variations in return because of changing
economic conditions. Rewards may be represented by the expectation of
profitable operation over the underlying asset’s economic life and of gain
from appreciation in value or realisation of a residual value.
A lease contract may include terms and conditions to adjust the lease
payments for particular changes that occur between the inception date and
the commencement date (such as a change in the lessor’s cost of the
underlying asset or a change in the lessor’s cost of financing the lease). In that
case, for the purposes of classifying the lease, the effect of any such changes
shall be deemed to have taken place at the inception date.
When a lease includes both land and buildings elements, a lessor shall assess
the classification of each element as a finance lease or an operating lease
separately applying paragraphs 62–66 and B53–B54. In determining whether
the land element is an operating lease or a finance lease, an important
consideration is that land normally has an indefinite economic life.
B51
B52
B53
B54
B55
IFRS 16
© IFRS Foundation
A857
Whenever necessary in order to classify and account for a lease of land and
buildings, a lessor shall allocate lease payments (including any lump-sum
upfront payments) between the land and the buildings elements in proportion
to the relative fair values of the leasehold interests in the land element and
buildings element of the lease at the inception date. If the lease payments
cannot be allocated reliably between these two elements, the entire lease is
classified as a finance lease, unless it is clear that both elements are operating
leases, in which case the entire lease is classified as an operating lease.
For a lease of land and buildings in which the amount for the land element is
immaterial to the lease, a lessor may treat the land and buildings as a single
unit for the purpose of lease classification and classify it as a finance lease or
an operating lease applying paragraphs 62–66 and B53–B54. In such a case, a
lessor shall regard the economic life of the buildings as the economic life of
the entire underlying asset.
Sublease classification
In classifying a sublease, an intermediate lessor shall classify the sublease as a
finance lease or an operating lease as follows:
(a)
if the head lease is a short-term lease that the entity, as a lessee, has
accounted for applying paragraph 6, the sublease shall be classified as
an operating lease.
(b)
otherwise, the sublease shall be classified by reference to the right-of-
use asset arising from the head lease, rather than by reference to the
underlying asset (for example, the item of property, plant or
equipment that is the subject of the lease).

(a)
to apply this Standard to contracts that were previously identified as
leases applying IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an
Arrangement contains a Lease. The entity shall apply the transition
requirements in paragraphs C5–C18 to those leases.
(b)
not to apply this Standard to contracts that were not previously
identified as containing a lease applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
If an entity chooses the practical expedient in paragraph C3, it shall disclose
that fact and apply the practical expedient to all of its contracts. As a result,
the entity shall apply the requirements in paragraphs 9–11 only to contracts
entered into (or changed) on or after the date of initial application.
Lessees
A lessee shall apply this Standard to its leases either:
(a)
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented applying IAS 8
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors; or
(b)
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the
Standard recognised at the date of initial application in accordance
with paragraphs C7–C13.
A lessee shall apply the election described in paragraph C5 consistently to all
of its leases in which it is a lessee.
If a lessee elects to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph C5(b),
the lessee shall not restate comparative information. Instead, the lessee shall
recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component
of equity, as appropriate) at the date of initial application.
Leases previously classified as operating leases
If a lessee elects to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph C5(b),
the lessee shall:
(a)
recognise a lease liability at the date of initial application for leases
previously classified as an operating lease applying IAS 17. The lessee
shall measure that lease liability at the present value of the remaining
lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate at the date of initial application.
(b)
recognise a right-of-use asset at the date of initial application for leases
previously classified as an operating lease applying IAS 17. The lessee
shall choose, on a lease-by-lease basis, to measure that right-of-use
asset at either:
(i)
its carrying amount as if the Standard had been applied since
the commencement date, but discounted using the lessee’s
incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application; or

recognised in the statement of financial position immediately
before the date of initial application.
(c)
apply IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to right-of-use assets at the date of
initial application, unless the lessee applies the practical expedient in
paragraph C10(b).
Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph C8, for leases previously
classified as operating leases applying IAS 17, a lessee:
(a)
is not required to make any adjustments on transition for leases for
which the underlying asset is of low value (as described in paragraphs
B3–B8) that will be accounted for applying paragraph 6. The lessee
shall account for those leases applying this Standard from the date of
initial application.
(b)
is not required to make any adjustments on transition for leases
previously accounted for as investment property using the fair value
model in IAS 40 Investment Property. The lessee shall account for the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability arising from those leases
applying IAS 40 and this Standard from the date of initial application.
(c)
shall measure the right-of-use asset at fair value at the date of initial
application for leases previously accounted for as operating leases
applying IAS 17 and that will be accounted for as investment property
using the fair value model in IAS 40 from the date of initial
application. The lessee shall account for the right-of-use asset and the
lease liability arising from those leases applying IAS 40 and this
Standard from the date of initial application.
A lessee may use one or more of the following practical expedients when
applying this Standard retrospectively in accordance with paragraph C5(b) to
leases previously classified as operating leases applying IAS 17. A lessee is
permitted to apply these practical expedients on a lease-by-lease basis:
(a)
a lessee may apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with
reasonably similar characteristics (such as leases with a similar
remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying asset in a similar
economic environment).
(b)
a lessee may rely on its assessment of whether leases are onerous
applying IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
immediately before the date of initial application as an alternative to
performing an impairment review. If a lessee chooses this practical
expedient, the lessee shall adjust the right-of-use asset at the date of
initial application by the amount of any provision for onerous leases
recognised in the statement of financial position immediately before
the date of initial application.

(c)
a lessee may elect not to apply the requirements in paragraph C8 to
leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of
initial application. In this case, a lessee shall:
(i)
account for those leases in the same way as short-term leases as
described in paragraph 6; and
(ii)
include the cost associated with those leases within the
disclosure of short-term lease expense in the annual reporting
period that includes the date of initial application.
(d)
a lessee may exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the
right-of-use asset at the date of initial application.
(e)
a lessee may use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if
the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.
Leases previously classified as finance leases
If a lessee elects to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph C5(b), for
leases that were classified as finance leases applying IAS 17, the carrying
amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial
application shall be the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability
immediately before that date measured applying IAS 17. For those leases, a
lessee shall account for the right-of-use asset and the lease liability applying
this Standard from the date of initial application.
Disclosure
If a lessee elects to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph C5(b),
the lessee shall disclose information about initial application required
by paragraph 28 of IAS 8, except for the information specified in
paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8. Instead of the information specified in
paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8, the lessee shall disclose:
(a)
the weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to
lease liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position at the
date of initial application; and
(b)
an explanation of any difference between:
(i)
operating lease commitments disclosed applying IAS 17 at the
end of the annual reporting period immediately preceding the
date of initial application, discounted using the incremental
borrowing rate at the date of initial application as described
in paragraph C8(a); and
(ii)
lease liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position
at the date of initial application.
If a lessee uses one or more of the specified practical expedients in
paragraph C10, it shall disclose that fact.

Lessors
Except as described in paragraph C15, a lessor is not required to make any
adjustments on transition for leases in which it is a lessor and shall account
for those leases applying this Standard from the date of initial application.
An intermediate lessor shall:
(a)
reassess subleases that were classified as operating leases applying
IAS 17 and are ongoing at the date of initial application, to determine
whether each sublease should be classified as an operating lease or a
finance lease applying this Standard. The intermediate lessor shall
perform this assessment at the date of initial application on the basis
of the remaining contractual terms and conditions of the head lease
and sublease at that date.
(b)
for subleases that were classified as operating leases applying IAS 17
but finance leases applying this Standard, account for the sublease as a
new finance lease entered into at the date of initial application.
Sale and leaseback transactions before the date of initial
application
An entity shall not reassess sale and leaseback transactions entered into before
the date of initial application to determine whether the transfer of the
underlying asset satisfies the requirements in IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a
sale.
If a sale and leaseback transaction was accounted for as a sale and a finance
lease applying IAS 17, the seller-lessee shall:
(a)
account for the leaseback in the same way as it accounts for any other
finance lease that exists at the date of initial application; and
(b)
continue to amortise any gain on sale over the lease term.
If a sale and leaseback transaction was accounted for as a sale and operating
lease applying IAS 17, the seller-lessee shall:
(a)
account for the leaseback in the same way as it accounts for any other
operating lease that exists at the date of initial application; and
(b)
adjust the leaseback right-of-use asset for any deferred gains or losses
that relate to off-market terms recognised in the statement of financial
position immediately before the date of initial application.
Amounts previously recognised in respect of business
combinations
If a lessee previously recognised an asset or a liability applying IFRS 3 Business
Combinations relating to favourable or unfavourable terms of an operating
lease acquired as part of a business combination, the lessee shall derecognise
that asset or liability and adjust the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset
by a corresponding amount at the date of initial application.

If an entity applies this Standard but does not yet apply IFRS 9 Financial
Instruments, any reference in this Standard to IFRS 9 shall be read as a
reference to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Covid-19-related rent concessions for lessees
A lessee shall apply Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (see paragraph C1A)
retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effect of initially applying that
amendment as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or
other component of equity, as appropriate) at the beginning of the annual
reporting period in which the lessee first applies the amendment.
In the reporting period in which a lessee first applies Covid-19-Related Rent
Concessions, a lessee is not required to disclose the information required by
paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8.
A lessee shall apply Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (see
paragraph C1C) retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effect of initially
applying that amendment as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the beginning of
the annual reporting period in which the lessee first applies the amendment.
In the reporting period in which a lessee first applies Covid-19-Related Rent
Concessions beyond 30 June 2021, a lessee is not required to disclose the
information required by paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8.
Applying paragraph 2 of this Standard, a lessee shall apply the practical
expedient in paragraph 46A consistently to eligible contracts with similar
characteristics and in similar circumstances, irrespective of whether the
contract became eligible for the practical expedient as a result of the lessee
applying Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (see paragraph C1A) or Covid-19-Related
Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (see paragraph C1C).
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2
An entity shall apply these amendments retrospectively in accordance with
IAS 8, except as specified in paragraph C20D.
An entity is not required to restate prior periods to reflect the application of
these amendments. The entity may restate prior periods if, and only if, it is
possible without the use of hindsight. If an entity does not restate prior
periods, the entity shall recognise any difference between the previous
carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of the annual
reporting period that includes the date of initial application of these
amendments in the opening retained earnings (or other component of equity,
as appropriate) of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial
application of these amendments.
